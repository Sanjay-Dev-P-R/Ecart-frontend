4. Lazy Loading
   Lazy loading is a technology of angular that allows you to load JavaScript components when a specific route is activated.
    It improves application load time speed by splitting the application into many bundles. 
    When the user navigates by the app, bundles are loaded as needed.

    Lazy loading helps to keep the bundle size small, which helps reduce load times. 
    We must use the class decorator to create an Angular module @NgModule, and the decorator uses a metadata object that defines the module.

5. create a new module in angular - here we create product module for implementing lazy loading
  

     ->ng g m products --route products --module app.module

6. create component in lazy loading module(product module)
   ->ng g c products/allProducts
   ->ng g c products/viewProducts
   ->ng g c products/wishlist
   ->ng g c products/cart

7. components thats not included in lazy loading module
   ->ng g c header
   ->ng g c footer 
   ->ng g c pageNotFound
     

8 services ng g s products/services/api
